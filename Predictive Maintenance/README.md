# Project Name: Customer Banking Behavior- Predictive Analytics.

## Project Description: 

In this project, I am implementing predictive maintenance model, using an example  scenario where the goal is to predict failures due to certain components of a machine. The analysis includes feature engineering, feature selection, labelling, training and evaluating this predictive model. Predictive models are built using Python packages.
