# Project Name: Peer to Peer Lending - Analysis.

## Project Description: 

Online Peer-to-Peer Lending has been on raise with both borrowers and lenders reaping profits over approaching banks for saving and borrowing respectively. I want to do some research on this Micro â€“ financing feature - Peer to Peer Lending in banking domain. Peer to Peer lending is considered as a risky but high return business. Lenders get better returns by lending to borrowers at a higher interest rate than what Banks offer for saving their money and for borrowers it gives them flexibility and cheaper rate than banks who check credit scores from credit reporting agencies before offering loans.
